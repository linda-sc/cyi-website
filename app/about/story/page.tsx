              Chinatown Youth Initiatives was founded with a simple yet powerful
              vision: to empower young people in Chinatown to become leaders,
              changemakers, and community advocates.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a small grassroots effort has grown into a
              thriving organization that serves hundreds of youth through
              multiple programs and initiatives each year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our story is one of community, resilience, and the belief that
              youth have the power to shape their futures and strengthen their
              communities.
